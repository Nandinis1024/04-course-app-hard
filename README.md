# Course Management Application

This is a Node.js application for managing courses and user registration. It uses the Express framework for building the API endpoints and MongoDB for data storage. The application allows administrators to manage courses and users to register, log in, and interact with courses.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies using the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
2. Set your MongoDB connection URI:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/course-app
   ```

3. Set your JWT secret key:

   ```
   SECRET_KEY=kittyxoxo12345678
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application by running:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The application will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

2. API Endpoints:

   - **Admin Registration:**
     - POST `/admin/signup`
     - Register an admin with the username "admin" and password "pass".

   - **Admin Login:**
     - POST `/admin/login`
     - Log in as an admin using the admin username and password.

   - **Admin Course Management:**
     - POST `/admin/courses`
       - Requires authentication
       - Create a new course.
     - PUT `/admin/courses/:courseId`
       - Requires authentication
       - Update a course by ID.
     - GET `/admin/courses`
       - Get a list of all courses.

   - **User Registration:**
     - POST `/users/signup`
     - Register a new user.

   - **User Login:**
     - POST `/users/login`
     - Log in as a user using the username and password.

   - **User Course Interaction:**
     - GET `/users/courses`
       - Requires authentication
       - Get a list of all courses available.
     - POST `/users/courses/:courseId`
       - Requires authentication
       - Enroll a user in a course by ID.
     - GET `/users/purchasedCourses`
       - Requires authentication
       - Get a list of courses purchased by the user.

3. The application uses JWT for authentication. When making requests that require authentication, include an `Authorization` header with a valid token:

   ```
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
   ```

## Database

- The application uses MongoDB to store data.
- Connection details are configured in the `.env` file.

## Models

- The application uses three models: `Admin`, `User`, and `Course`.

## Error Handling

- The application provides basic error handling and responses for common scenarios.

## Security

- The application uses JWT for user authentication.
- Please ensure that the secret key is kept secure and not hardcoded in the source code.

## Note

- This README provides a basic overview of the application's functionality. For more details, refer to the code comments and explore the API endpoints.
